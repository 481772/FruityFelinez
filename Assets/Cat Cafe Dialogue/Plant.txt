Hello there, this caf√© is very in-tree-guing! I'd love to have a refreshing treet to help me grow, wooden you think?

1. Your jokes are very funny!
Why thank you! I would love to travel and share my jokes with the world, but I feel a little... rooted down. Sadly, most folks can't carry my weight. It really limits my transportation, so it's a real pine in the neck. I wish there was something strong enough to carry me around. Ah, don't mind me, I'm just getting all sappy now.

2. Your puns suck.
I might be going out on a limb here, but I think we got off on the wrong branch... Either way, I think it's about time I make like a tree and leaf.

Wrong Drink: I don't feel very good...

Right Drink: I feel great! I can feel the energy in my leaves!

Wrong Cat: This cat is nice, but it's not like I can pet them or anything.

Right Cat: I can't be-leaf it, this cat is perfect! They're definitely strong enough to carry me around. This is tree-mendous, now I can share my jokes with the world!
