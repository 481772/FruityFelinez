It's been so long since I've visited the overworld, and yet it's stayed exactly the same. Well, this café is new at least. I only consume the finest food and drink, so hopefully you have something that cau suit my needs.

1. How was your drink?
Splendid. However, you have all these cats here, and so far none have even come near me. Are they scared? I may be the prince of hell, but even I'd like to have a furry partner in crime.

2. Are you here to take me to hell?
What? No— well not right now at least. I just get sick of the food down there every once in a while. Speaking of which, it's almost time for my daily soul-torturing, so I better head out. See you soon!

Wrong Drink: Ew. No way am I drinking this.

Right Drink: This drink is perfect. I can tell it is some pure blood.

Wrong Cat: This cat looks like it would rather be anywhere else than here.

Right Cat: Ooh... This cat is perfect! It seems like just the type to scratch people for no reason. Thank you!
