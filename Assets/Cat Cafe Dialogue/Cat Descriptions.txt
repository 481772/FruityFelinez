Pixie
This is a really affectionate cat. They make you feel less lonely with their comforting style.

Clover
This cat has survived six cart crashes, consumed at least two quarts of U-238, and has come out unharmed from multiple assassination attempts. Her pure luck seems to rub off on people.

Luci
This cat has not done a single good deed in its life. They are highly suspected for multiple murders, but so far, no conclusive evidence has been found.

Bubbles
Not always what people expect.

Tom
This cat can not only talk, but he talks so much that even the most avid chatters cannot compete and are forced into silence.
