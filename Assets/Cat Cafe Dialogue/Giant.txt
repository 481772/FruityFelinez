Hello down there! Sorry about your roof... I wish I wasn't as... well... giant. It makes everything so difficult.

1. How does being smaller feel?
It feels great! But still, I've always been so strong and large, even like this. We're at a cat café, but I don't want to touch any of the cats because they're not strong enough to handle it without getting hurt.

2. You should get out of here now, before you damage the café any more.
Oh... yeah, you're probably right. I'll get out of here now I guess...

Wrong Drink: That's a nice drink, I guess. I would go now, but I wouldn't really fit through the door...

Right Drink: This is amazing! I can't believe I'm the same size as everything now, wow.

Wrong Cat: I probably shouldn't touch this cat, I don't want to hurt them.

Right Cat: This cat is so buff, I can pet it easily! Thank you!
