Sorry for all my tears, but I just lost my beloved cat yesterday. I wish there was a way to make me feel better, because the world feels so empty without my little Apple...

1. I'm sorry for your loss. Is there anything else I can do to help?
Thank you, I do feel a bit better now, but I still feel very lonely without her with me.

2. Are you done with all the waterworks now?
sobbing crying yaknow the works

Wrong Drink: waaaaaaaa *continues crying and stuff*

Right Drink: I honestly don't feel as distraught anymore. Thank you so much!

Wrong Cat: This cat is very nice and all, but they're nothing like my Apple...

Right Cat: Aww, I love them! I feel much better now, thank you!
