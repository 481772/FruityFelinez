I would ask for one of your more popular drinks, but I've had a pretty bad day, and I doubt any of your human stuff is strong enough.

1. So, what's it like being a robot?
Well, it certainly has its perks, but most folks don't talk to me because of it. Being a robot is often a sad, solitary existence.

2. Do you want me to get you some motor oil to drink instead or something?
How dare you assume all robots drink oil! Only the most crude machines rely on such basic substances. If that's all you think of me, maybe it's better if I leave.

Wrong Drink: This drink is definitely not strong enough for me. I need something made for us robots.

Right Drink: Ahhh... This is perfect. I've needed something like this for a while.

Wrong Cat: This cat is nice, but I don't think it likes me very much.

Right Cat: This cat is amazing, I feel so welcome now. Thank you!
