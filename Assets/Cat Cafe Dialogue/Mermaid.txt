*huff* I've been away from the sea for so long, and I just found out that my boyfriend is cheating on me! He may be a pirate but he doesn't need to keep going back to his X.

1. I hope he gets what he deserves, is there anything else I can do to make you feel better?
Well, I do wish I had something to remind me of home, before I met that stupid pirate that convinced me to explore the world outside of the sea.

2. We can take you into the kitchen and you can help make our new sushi dishes!
OH MY GOD WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU AAAAAAA	

Wrong Drink: Thanks, but I still don't know what to do about my boyfriend. Or ex-boyfriend now...

Right Drink: That stupid pirate deserves to feel my wrath! I swear I am going to shove that hook of his so far up his- Sorry, I think I got a bit carried away there.

Wrong Cat: Normal cats don't usually like water, I don't think.

Right Cat: Aw, they're perfect! Finally, a cat that will swim with me. Thank you!
