The other day someone told me they liked my antlers, and I couldn't even say thank you because I'm so shy! I wish I could just get over it and talk to people. *under breath* Or at least talk to her...

1. So, who's the lucky girl?

Oh! You heard that? Yeah, I wanted to ask her out, but I didn't know how. Now though, I'm going to ask her, and if I'm lucky enough, she'll say yes!

2. Now go ask "her" out so she can reject you already.

You really think she won't like me? Oh god, that's my worst nightmare!

Wrong Drink: Oh... thank you I guess.

Right Drink: Thank you so much! I feel like I can actually talk to people now, this is amazing!

Wrong Cat: This cat is... cute. Thanks.

Right Cat: Honestly, this cat makes me feel like I can do it! I'm going to go ask her, thank you!
