... Sorry, I was doing my homework. I think someone's cursed me! I'm so studious, yet I keep failing my sorcery classes. Got anything for me?

1. Do you think you can handle your class now?
Yes, thank you! But even though I can understand everything we've learned now, it would take a lot of luck for me to be able to pass after the amount of tests I've failed.

2. I don't think even that drink can save you from an F.
Wow, thanks for your opinion. I'm going to go study more now.

Wrong Drink: This drink is nice, but it's hard to enjoy it when I'm stressing out about school.

Right Drink: Everything is making sense again! I actually get what's going on in class now, thank you so much.

Wrong Cat: This is a nice cat, but I should probably go review my notes or something.

Right Cat: For some reason, I'm feeling really lucky! I think I'm going to talk to my professor and do my best to pass my classes, thank you!
